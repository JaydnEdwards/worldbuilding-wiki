The Circle of Knowing is a group of twelve researchers and scholars known as Archons in Final Fantasy XIV. The group was founded by Louisoix Leveilleur dedicated to the salvation of Eorzea. The members of the Circle of Knowing are prominent figures in the Main Scenario quests and Seventh Umbral Era storyline in original Final Fantasy XIV. The Warrior of Light would interact with different members depending on which nation they created their character in, and which Grand Company they chose. This determines which member of the Circle defends the Warrior when he or she is later attacked by Gaius van Baelsar.

The Circle of Knowing hails from the city-state of Sharlayan in the northwestern Dravania region. They are marked by the tattoo on their neck.
