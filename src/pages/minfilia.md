description: 'Minfilia is a Highlander Hyur who keeps her blonde hair in a ponytail with long bangs hanging down the sides of her face. In the original Final Fantasy XIV, she wore a pink half-top, brown culottes, and fingerless gloves. As she was never seen in battle, she could dress more casually than most characters.'

Minfilia Warde is a prominent non-player character in Final Fantasy XIV. She was once the leader of the Path of the Twelve, an organization of people touched by the Echo, and guided walkers of the Path how to use it to bring about peace. She first appeared in Ul'dah's main storyline as Ascilia, daughter of Warburton. Minfilia somewhat abruptly exited the story as the Seventh Umbral Era plotline began to take precedence to set up A Realm Reborn.

In the Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn re-release, the Path of the Twelve has merged with the Circle of Knowing to form the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, with Minfilia at the head.
