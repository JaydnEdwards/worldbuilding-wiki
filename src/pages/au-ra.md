The Au Ra (pronounced OW-rah) is a race from Final Fantasy XIV and the first game-original playable race. They were introduced in the first expansion, Final Fantasy XIV: Heavensward, and several Au Ra non-player characters play a major role in the second expansion, Final Fantasy XIV: Stormblood.
Similar to the other races in Final Fantasy XIV, there are two clans for the Au Ra: the bright-scaled Au Ra Raen (アウラ・レン, Aura Ren?) and dark-scaled Au Ra Xaela (アウラ・ゼラ, Aura Zera?). Yugiri Mistwalker, an Au Ra, is one of the leaders of the Raen and led a group of human refugees from Doma to Eorzea.

The adjectival form of Au Ra is Auri (Pronounced Ow-Ree), while the plural appears to be Au Ra.[1]
