Aldgoats are denizens of rocky, mountainous regions, indiscriminately eating any vegetation they happen across. They have thick, wooly coats and sharp horns, though the horns of the males are markedly larger than those of the females. These horns are highly sought after for their potency in various magical endeavors. The aldgoat also has a protective ring of tough flesh around its necks, which serves to defend against the bites of predators. Aldgoats can be successfully domesticated and raised as livestock provided they are broken before their second year.
