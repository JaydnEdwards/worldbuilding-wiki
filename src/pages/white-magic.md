White magic, the arcane art of succor, was conceived eras past that the world might know comfort. Alas, man began perverting its powers for self-gain, and by his wickedness brought about the Sixth Umbral catastrophe. Although the art subsequently became forbidden, it is now in the midst of a revival at the hands of the Padjal, chosen of the elementals.

Those who would walk the path of the white mage are healers without peer, possessed of the power to deliver comrades from the direst of afflictionsâ€”even the icy grip of death itself.
